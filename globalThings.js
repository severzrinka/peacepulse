  `Equal breathing, also known as "Sama Vritti" in Sanskrit, is a simple yet effective breathing technique often used in yoga and meditation practices. The goal of this technique is to balance and calm the mind and body by equalizing the lengths of your inhalations and exhalations. This technique can be particularly helpful for reducing stress, improving focus, and preparing for meditation or sleep. Inhale for a Count of Four then Exhale for a Count of Four`,
  `The 4-7-8 breathing technique, also known as "relaxing breath," is a method developed by Dr. Andrew Weil. It's designed to help reduce anxiety, help people get to sleep, and manage stress. This technique works by allowing the body to absorb more oxygen, calming the nervous system and promoting a state of calm. It also helps to regulate the body's fight-or-flight response, which can be triggered by stress. Inhale Through the Nose for 4 Seconds, hold Your Breath for 7 Seconds and exhale Through the Mouth for 8 Seconds.`,
  `Box breathing, also known as square breathing, is a simple yet effective technique used to manage stress and improve concentration. Box breathing is beneficial because it helps regulate the autonomic nervous system. It can reduce stress, enhance concentration, and improve mental clarity. This technique is often used by athletes, military personnel, and others in high-stress situations to maintain calm and focus. Inhale through your nose while counting to four. Hold your breath, and again count to four. Exhale through your mouth for another count of four.`,
